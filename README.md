# Define-Text-Macros
This Verilog code demonstrates the usage of text macros defined with the `define` directive. It defines macros for a numeric value, a string, and arithmetic operations. The test module then showcases how these macros can be utilized within the code. It displays the predefined numeric value, string, and the result of an arithmetic operation. Furthermore, it employs a macro for a custom operation, displaying its scope and executing it within the code. This example illustrates the convenience and flexibility offered by text macros in Verilog for defining reusable code snippets and enhancing readability.
